TODO: Do this


Metrics:
    timestamp optimized (too many series session_id)
    series size is huge but length is tiny (session_id is the key)
Series:
    measurement name optimized (most efficient if not many series)
    usually want to access the timeline of that measuerment 

prefixType: time,key to build key
